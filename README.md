# Introduction

Changes in the life style of people due to urbanization and several other factors leads to the increase in the number of diabetes patients. This disease is a challenge to the health care sector as it's difficult to cure a patient completely, if once he got affected.

Major factors associated with the diabetes are:

1) Are overweight.
2) Are 45 years or older. Have a parent, brother, or sister with type 2 diabetes.
3) Are physically active less than 3 times a week.
4) Have ever had gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) or given birth to a baby who weighed over 9 pounds.

## Aim 
**To find the major factors associated with the diabetes in women with the help of EDA.**

### Dataset
This dataset comes from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

**Variables used in the dataset:**


1) Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.

2) Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test. (155 mg/dL or lower - normal, otherwise - prediabetes).

3) Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) (60 to 80 - normal, otherwise - Hypotension and Hypertension).

4) Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) (Average value is 23.6 ± 7.5 mm for women).

5) Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) ( 16-166 mIU/L or mu U/ml is considered normal ).

6) BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) (< 18.5 Underweight, 18.5—24.9 Healthy Weight, 25.0—29.9 Overweight, > 30.0 Obesity).

7) Diabetes Pedigree Function: Diabetes pedigree function (indicates the function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history).

8) Age: Age (years).

Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) 0 mean non-diabetic and 1 means diabetic.
